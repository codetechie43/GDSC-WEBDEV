Simple CRUD To-Do List Application

Overview:
This document provides an explanation of a simple To-Do List application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The application allows users to manage tasks by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting them. It features a clean user interface with popup messages to provide feedback on user actions.

CRUD Functionality:
- Create (Add): Users can enter a task in the input field and press the "Add" button or hit Enter to add it to the list. A new task is created and displayed in the list.
- Read (View): The application displays a list of tasks that users have added. Each task is shown with its text and can be visually marked as completed.
- Update (Edit): Users can edit a task by clicking the "Edit" button associated with it. This switches the task to edit mode, allowing users to modify the task's text. After editing, users can save the changes, updating the task's text.
- Delete: Each task has a "Delete" button associated with it. Clicking this button removes the task from the list.

Technical Details:
- HTML: The structure of the application is defined using HTML. It includes input fields, buttons, and a list to display tasks.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for styling the application. It provides the layout, colors, and animations to enhance the user interface.
- JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is used for the application's logic. It handles user interactions, such as adding, deleting, editing, and completing tasks. It also manages popup messages to provide feedback to the user.

Implementation:
- Event Listeners: Event listeners are used to capture user actions, such as form submissions, button clicks, and checkbox changes.
- DOM Manipulation: JavaScript manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) to add, remove, or modify elements in the HTML page dynamically.
- CRUD Operations: JavaScript functions implement CRUD operations for managing tasks. Functions handle adding tasks, updating task text, deleting tasks, and marking tasks as completed.
- Popup Messages: Popup messages are displayed using JavaScript to provide real-time feedback to the user about the success or failure of their CRUD actions.
- CSS Animations: CSS animations are used to add visual effects, such as fading in/out, to improve the user experience.
